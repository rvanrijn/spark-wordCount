/**
 * The scala Spark API documentation: http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html
 *
 * Here the goal is to count how much each word appears in a file and make some operation on the result.
 * We use the mapreduce pattern to do this:
 *
 * step 1, the mapper:
 * - we attribute 1 to each word. And we obtain then couples (word, 1), where word is the key.
 *
 * step 2, the reducer:
 * - for each key (=word), the values are added and we will obtain the total amount.
